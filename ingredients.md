paneer – You can either use homemade Paneer or use the store-bought one. If using store-bought paneer, you can soak the Paneer cubes in warm water for about 4 to 5 minutes, to make it soft.

Shahi Masala – We will make a special Shahi Masala which is prepared using clove, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns, black cardamom, cashew nuts, and browned onions.

You can prepare the browned onions beforehand and store so that it comes in handy while preparing this Shahi masala. You can find the recipe here – Fried Onions.

Oil/Ghee – I have used both oil and ghee, but you can use either of them to make this curry.

Yogurt – Yogurt adds a nice creamy texture in the curry. Before adding yogurt, taste the same and see if it’s not sour. If it is sour it will ruin the taste of the curry too.

Spice Powders – We will add some basic spice powders such as coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and salt. You can adjust the amount of spices according to your taste.




Saffron – Saffron is mixed with water and then added to curry, to add taste and rich flavor.

Kewra Water – To add some more royal flavor in the curry, we will also add in kewra water. You can easily find kewra water in your nearby Indian grocery store.

Coriander Leaves – Finally, finish off the curry by garnishing it with some freshly chopped coriander leaves.
